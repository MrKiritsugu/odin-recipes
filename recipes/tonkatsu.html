    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This air fryer tonkatsu recipe is crispy on the outside and tender and
      juicy on the inside. You can buy bottled sauce, but this homemade version
      is simple to make and far better. Serve over rice if desired.

      <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sauce: Whisk together ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, sherry,
        Worcestershire sauce, and garlic in a medium bowl <br> until sugar is
        dissolved. Set sauce aside.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Prepare pork chops: Lay pork chops on a clean work surface; season with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Beat eggs in a flat dish. Place bread crumbs in a separate flat dish.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Dip a pork chop in beaten eggs, then dredge in bread crumbs. Dip again
        in eggs, then press in bread crumbs to thoroughly coat. <br> Repeat with
        remaining pork chops.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Place pork chops in the basket of the preheated air fryer and spray the
        tops with nonstick cooking spray. Air-fry for 10 minutes. <br> Flip chops
        over using a spatula and spray the tops with nonstick cooking spray
        again. Air-fry for 10 more minutes. An instant-read <br> thermometer inserted
        into the center of pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and slice. Serve with sauce.
