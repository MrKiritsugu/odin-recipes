    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <ol class="list">
        <li>
          Whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar,
          Worcestershire, sesame oil, sugar, Sriracha, and garlic in a small
          bowl; set aside. <br />
          Remove root ends from scallions and discard. Chop whites and light
          greens into 2-inch pieces and quarter pieces lengthwise; set aside.
          <br />
          Thinly slice remaining dark greens of scallions and reserve for
          garnish.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add
          mushrooms in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on
          first side,
          <br />
          about 3 minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally,
          until mushrooms are tender and golden brown on both sides, about 4
          <br />
          more minutes. Add bok choy, carrots, sliced whites and light greens of
          scallions, and 1/4 cup water to pan with mushrooms. Cook, stirring
          <br />
          occasionally, until vegetables are just tender, about 3 minutes.

        <li>
          Add udon noodles and remaining 1/4 cup water and cook, gently
          separating noodles with tongs or spoon. Add reserved oyster sauce
          mixture <br />
          and cook, stirring constantly, until noodles and vegetables are
          well-coated, about 1 minute. Divide among serving bowls and garnish
          with
          <br />
          reserved sliced greens of scallions and optional garnishes. Serve
